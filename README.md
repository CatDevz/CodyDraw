# CodyDraw
A basic drawing/animating program made in python for school, might add more features at a later date but who knows

# Description

The main feature of my program is drawing, you can draw simply by left clicking with the mouse and dragging. You can also erase if you hold down the right click.

Colors can be selected by either using the color picker, or a mixture of key binds to come up with custom colors. You will also see the 3 most recently used colors at the bottom. Once getting a custom color you can then save it on the color picker by just right clicking and it will replace the color in that location with your custom color of choice.

My program has full support for saving and loading, which can be accessed only using a few, simple key binds. Simply hitting “S” will allow you to save your project. Upon saving a new text file representing that image will be created in “/files/drawings/” titled whatever you called it. In order to load an image now we hit “O” and type in that same name.

If you go back to the main menu and click the second button you are able to animate. Animations aren’t much different than drawings, they can be saved/loaded, have as many colors, exc. However animations are, well animated, in our case frame by frame with no limit on frames. You can toggle onion skinning by pressing “a”, so you can see a basic preview of your previous and next frame. Pressing the space bar will toggle play mode, and just like in painting mode the UI can be hidden by pressing “Tab”. Here is a gif of this animation in action https://gfycat.com/remorsefulportlyaoudad
